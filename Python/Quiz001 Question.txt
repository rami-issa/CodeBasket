Distribute an array of numbers [1, N] over a triangle to make the summation of numbers on each side equal
Then print out the possible numbers on each side


Notes: 
1- This can be implemented using permutations
2- Numbers can not be duplicated, each number in the array should be used once only
3- The shortest set of numbers that can be distributed are [1, 6] on a triangle that has 3 joints and 3 side nodes (one node on each side)
4- Example: An array of [1, 9] can be distributed on a triangle that has 3 joints and 6 side nodes (2 nodes on each side). In this case: one edge of the triangle will have 4 numbers (2 joints, and 2 side nodes).
5- Each edge of the triangle should have similar count of distributed numbers
